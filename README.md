# Digital Signal Processing Algorithms in C and Rust

This Git repository contains my implementations of various Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms in both C and Rust programming languages. As part of my journey through an online DSP course, I've developed these algorithms to gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of DSP concepts.

The included algorithms cover a wide range of DSP topics, including Convolution Kernel, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, Windowed-Sinc filters, Modified Sallen-Key filters, Bessel, Chebyshev, and Butterworth filters, as well as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
